This is my post following Jon MIlls' Plural Sight RESTful Web Services with Node.js and Express tutorial

Node.js is a simple and powerful tool for backend development. When combined with express, you can create lightweight, fast, scalable APIs quickly and simply.

Setup unit and end to end integration tests for our services.
